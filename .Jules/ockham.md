## 2025-05-26 - [Dead Code Removal] **Observation:** Found `tool.py` referencing non-existent modules (`src.jules_client`) and duplicate/transitional top-level service files (`src/gemini_client.py`, etc.) that were superseded by `src/services/`. This created confusion and potential security risks (`src/scraper.py` lacked SSRF protection). **Action:** Deleted `tool.py`, `src/gemini_client.py`, `src/github_client.py`, and `src/scraper.py`. Verified no usages in active codebase via grep and tests.

## 2026-01-28 - [Complexity Reduction]
**Target:** `print_panel` in `src/utils/reporter.py`
**Delta:** Complexity Score 13 -> 3
**Summary:** Extracted border creation and text wrapping logic into `_create_top_border` and `_wrap_content` helper functions. This simplified the main `print_panel` function significantly while maintaining identical output behavior.

## 2026-01-29 - [Complexity Reduction]
**Target:** `scrape_text` in `src/services/scraper.py`
**Delta:** Complexity Score C -> B
**Summary:** Extracted HTTP request handling and error mapping into a private helper function `_fetch_url`. This separated the network concerns from the HTML parsing logic, removing nested exception handlers and flattening the main function's control flow.
